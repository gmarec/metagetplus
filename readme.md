# metaget

A Node.js module to fetch HTML meta tags (including Open Graph), favicons and title from a remote URL

## Installation

```
npm install metagetplus --save
```

## Usage

``` javascript
var metagetplus = require("metagetplus");
metagetplus.fetch('https://wordpress.com', function (err, meta_response) {
	if(err){
		console.log(err);
	}else{
		console.log(meta_response);
	}
});
```

Response will be a Javascript Object containing all the meta tags from the URL. All tags are output in the example above. Some tags with illegal characters can be accessed by:

``` javascript
meta_response["og:title"];
```

## Options

It's possible to set any HTTP headers in the request. This can be done by specifying them as options in the call. If no options are provided the only default header is a User-Agent of "request".

This is how you would specify a "User-Agent" of a Google Bot:

``` javascript
var metagetplus = require("metagetplus");
metagetplus.fetch('https://wordpress.com',{headers:{"User-Agent": "Googlebot"}}, function (err, meta_response) {
	if(err){
		console.log(err);
	}else{
		console.log(meta_response);
	}
});
```

## Release

0.0.5 improve charset detection
0.0.4 add some charset detection in http response and in meta, remove unwanted newlines
